# Projet Lôcal e-shop
Whell, that's it ! One and a half year after the start of my training as a java full-stack developer,
the day of my exam is here. Local is my "masterwork" project that I am presenting to the jury.

This is a full-stack e-commerce web app, with a back-end REST Api coded in Spring Boot 2.6.7 and an Angular 13 front-end,
using data from a MySQL database. It integrates the HTTPS protocole, using a self-signed certificate (for demo purposes),
as well as the Okta authorisation and authentication server. It also integrates a test Stripe payment processor, through a
developer free account.
